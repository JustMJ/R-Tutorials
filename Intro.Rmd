# Checking your R version and Updating

Every once and a while R releases a new version of the software. This *will not* download automagically, so you should check the r website https://www.r-project.org/ from time to time, or follow them on twitter. You can see what version you are currently on by entering `version` into the console. 

# Installing and Loading Packages

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#install.packages()
#require()
#library()
```

# Reading in Data

## CSV files

There are three main ways to read in csv files. First, you can use base R with the function `read.csv`. Alternatively you can use the `read_csv` function from the readr package. The final way is with the `fread` function from the data.table package. 
```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
iris.1<- read.csv("./data/iris.csv")
iris.2<- read_csv("./data/iris.csv")
iris.3<- fread("./data/iris.csv")
```

## Excel files

For excel files, you can use the readxl package. *Note:* if you have multiple sheets you will need to specify which sheet you want to read in. 

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
readxl_example("deaths.xlsx")
iris.4<-read_excel(readxl_example("deaths.xlsx"))
```

## Data from a website

In this example we are downloading movie data from GitHub. Note that this isn't web scraping, this is merely accessing a previously compiled dataset, which in this case is in csv format. Reading in data from a website is helpful if you are accessing archival datasets etc. We won't get into APIs just yet but this is the first step in that direction. 

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
movies <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/fandango/fandango_score_comparison.csv",header=TRUE)
```
```{r}
head(movies)
```

### Magrittr

Lets start with the basic pipe operator `%>%`

The other operator that is useful to know is `%<>%`. This operator at the beginning of a pipe sequence assigns the results to the original variable foregoing the ubiquitious assignment procedure `<-`.
```{r}
